# 3DPGS-DMAIC-Project

DMAIC – 3D Printed Gear Quality Project

This project uses a small 3D-printing setup to run a full **DMAIC** improvement cycle on the quality of 3D printed planet gears for a planetary gearset. The goal is to treat the print process like a real production line, collect data, and improve failure/defect rates using quality tools and machine learning.
