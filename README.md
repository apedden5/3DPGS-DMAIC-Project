# 3DPGS-DMAIC-Project


This project uses a small 3D-printing setup to run a full **DMAIC** improvement cycle on the quality of 3D printed planet gears for a planetary gearset. The goal is to treat the print process like a real production line, collect data, and improve failure/defect rates using quality tools and machine learning.

This repository as of now just contains the define phase of the project which is located in the report section.  Stay tuned for custom ML models for root cause analysis and the rest of the DMAIC project!
